---- Current tasks ---- X = Done, ? = Unsure, . = Partially complete
[X]  Define data set
        Use maia test set: December 2019. With their preprocessing. 
        Make trainings set: January 2019
        Also run maia on other test sets: other to show it does not generalize. 

[ ]  Implement more chess heuristics, including weighing pst, as parameters in the model. Weigh this against observed performance.
[ ]     Implement BO to make optimization more robust.
[ ]          Generate plots of optimization function to characterize it.

[.]  Do the comparison. Produce the plots:
[.]      Validation of sunfish method. Convergence plots (100 epochs) on Sunfish moves and player moves.
        [X] Run 1100,1900 on player and sunfish moves
        [ ] Run 1300, 1500, 1700
[.]      Accuracy of Maia and Sunfish models at different ELO, trained on different ELO levels
                Same as in Maia paper. With baselines.
        [X] Maia model only plot
        [.] Add Sunfish
[.]      Accuracy over ply. How many moves into the game. 
        [X] Implement script to run plots
        [X] Run on models at 1100, 1900
        [ ] Run 1300, 1500, 1700
[ ]      Accuracy as function of training data set size (sunfish and maia)
        [ ] Set up Maia training 
        [ ] Set up Sunfish training
        [ ] Plot

[ ]  Detailed characterization of Bayesian IRL. How our model relates to IRL.
[ ]  Why do other methods not work.
[ ]  If others work, implement them. Look from specific opening 6 ply forward, so occupancy ratios work. 

[ ]  Qualitlively compare key positions and blunder prediction, so we can discuss searching vs. not searching
[ ]     Show in demonstrations in jupyter notebooks.   


---- Less important notes
[ ]  Discussion: Bridging the gap between symbolic and data driven AI to maintain explainability
[ ]  Go through specific case studies
[ ]  Show in demonstrations in jupyter notebooks.   
[ ]  Implement more baselines to validate method

[.]    Go through Berkely Deep RL course
[.]    Read and understand reading list (see reading list section)



[ ]    Run the following experiments for actual results:
        - Sunfish moves
            - Lower vs higher ELO
                - Sunfish
                - (Maia?)
        - Player game moves
            - Lower vs higher ELO
                - Sunfish
                - Maia
            - Test on player games
        - Player puzzle moves
            - Lower vs higher ELO
                - Sunfish
                - Maia
            - Test on player games
