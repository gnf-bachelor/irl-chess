----- Notes from Tue -------

Presentér processen af projektet i IRL, mål om at lave IRL, endte med en noget anderledes approach

Indre RL loop med én iteration af policy iteration, inspireret IRL. Vi optimerer policyen ligesom en imitation learning, men med en reqrd vektor der kan fortolkes.

Vi skal flette alt ind vi har lavet, men de mere perifære ting skal præsenteres som sådan.

Ca træningstid er fint.

Stor introduktion, klare læringsobjektiver bliver defineret her - muligvis i bullet points.

Plots skal ikke være repetitive

Konklusionen skal holde sig tæt op af læringsmålene, og adressere dem. 

Outcome: baseline for IRL på skak, fixed bug i Sunfish, skak-heuristikker.

Helt fast på definitionerne af IRL og imitation learning i introduktionen.
