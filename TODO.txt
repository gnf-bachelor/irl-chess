---- Current tasks ----
[x]    Get sunfish up and running.
[ ]        Write trainable alpha-beta search function weighted with BIRL heuristics.
[ ]        Combine the two by permuting the weights and using the function to approximate the true ones
[ ]            Evaluate performance
[ ]                Evaluate heuristics qualitatively for different trained chess engines.

[X]    Segment Lichess dataset and make it amenable to Bayesian IRL algorithm.
[ ]        Begin with a small sample.
[ ]    Go through Berkely Deep RL course
[ ]    Read and understand reading list

[ ]     Implement evaluation for king safety, pawn structure, etc.
[ ]     Implement self-play for sunfish vs sunfish with moderated eval function.




---- Tentative timeline ----

1st March:
    Finish projektplan
    Complete Berkely Deep RL course
    Complete reading list and have strong overview of modern IRL methods

    Ideally having minimum working prototype 

1st April:

1st May:


6th June:
    Submission deadline
